# Loan-Risk-Classification

## Project Description:
Through utilizing a historical lending dataset from a peer-to-peer lending services, this project serves to build a model to identify the creditworthiness of loan borrowers. The raw lending datatset is cleaned so that unnecessary columns that serve little purpose are removed and catergorical variables are turned into dummy variables for the classification model. After, the data is normalized and scaled and split into training and testing datasets. A logistic regression model was trained with the original model and resampled version of the original data was used to make predictions to identify healthy or high-risk loans. A confusion matrix and classification report was also utilized to evaluate the precision, recall, and accuracy of the model. A credit risk analysis report based on the model findings and predictions is included as well.
